### Vending Machine

Exercise to recreate a Vending Machine using Ruby

### Specs

The vending machine should perform as follows:

- Once an item is selected and the appropriate amount of money is inserted, the vending machine should return the correct product.

- It should also return change if too much money is provided, or ask for more money if insufficient funds have been inserted.

- The machine should take an initial load of products and change. The change will be of denominations 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p,
50p, £1, £2.

- There should be a way of reloading either products or change at a later point.

- The machine should keep track of the products and change that it contains.​

### Things to improve

- Add a web interface and an API to create a real application.
- Add CLI to allow users interact via terminal.
- And more logic to try recreate as much as possible a real Vending Machine.
